"Journal Article","Using machine learning algorithms to predict the effects of change processes in psychotherapy: Toward process-level treatment personalization.","This study aimed to develop and test algorithms to determine the individual relevance of two psychotherapeutic change processes (i.e., mastery and clarification) for outcome prediction. We measured process and outcome variables in a naturalistic outpatient sample treated with an integrative treatment for a variety of diagnoses (n = 608) during the first 10 sessions. We estimated individual within-patient effects of each therapist-evaluated process of change on patient-evaluated subsequent outcomes on a session-by-session basis. Using patients’ baseline characteristics, we trained machine learning algorithms on a randomly selected subsample (n = 407) to predict the effects of patients’ process variables on outcome. We subsequently tested the predictive capacity of the best algorithm for each process on a holdout subsample (n = 201). We found significant within-patient effects of therapist perceived mastery and clarification on subsequent outcome. In the holdout subsample, the best-performing algorithms resulted in significant but small-to-medium correlations between the predicted and observed relevance of therapist perceived mastery (r = .18) and clarification (r = .16). Using the algorithms to create criteria for individual recommendations, in the holdout sample, we identified patients for whom mastery (14%) or clarification (18%) were indicated. In the mastery-indicated group, a greater focus on mastery was moderately associated with better outcome (r = .33, d = .70), while in the clarification-indicated group, the focus was not related to outcome (r = −.05, d = .10). Results support the feasibility of performing individual predictions regarding mastery process relevance that can be useful for therapist feedback and treatment recommendations. However, results will need to be replicated with prospective experimental designs.

"Journal Article","Application of machine learning-based models to boost the predictive power of the SPAN index.","Background: This study re-explored the predictive validity of Stroke Prognostication using Age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (SPAN) index in patients who received different treatments for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and developed machine learning-boosted outcome prediction models. Methods: We evaluated the prognostic relevance of SPAN index in patients with AIS who received intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV-tPA), intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) or non-thrombolytic treatments (non-tPA), and applied machine learning algorithms to develop SPAN-based outcome prediction models in a cohort of 2145 hospitalized AIS patients. The performance of the models was assessed and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). Results: SPAN index ≥100 was associated with higher mortality rate and higher modified Rankin Scale at discharge in AIS patients who received the different treatments. Compared to the lower AUCs for the SPAN-alone model across all groups, the AUCs of the logistic regression-boosted model were 0.838, 0.857, 0.766 and 0.875 for the whole cohort, non-tPA, IV-tPA and IAT groups, respectively. Similarly, the AUCs of the generated artificial neural network were 0.846, 0.858, 0.785 and 0.859 for the whole cohort, non-tPA, IV-tPA and IAT groups, respectively, while for gradient boosting decision tree model, we computed 0.850, 0.863, 0.779 and 0.815. Conclusions: SPAN index has prognostic relevance in patients with AIS who received different treatments. The generated machine learning-based models exhibit good performance for predicting the functional recovery of AIS; thus, their proposed clinical application to aid outcome prediction and decision-making for the patients with AIS.

"Journal Article","Evidence for machine learning guided early prediction of acute outcomes in the treatment of depressed children and adolescents with antidepressants.","Background: The treatment of depression in children and adolescents is a substantial public health challenge. This study examined artificial intelligence tools for the prediction of early outcomes in depressed children and adolescents treated with fluoxetine, duloxetine, or placebo. Methods: The study samples included training datasets (N = 271) from patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) treated with fluoxetine and testing datasets from patients with MDD treated with duloxetine (N = 255) or placebo (N = 265). Treatment trajectories were generated using probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). Unsupervised machine learning identified specific depressive symptom profiles and related thresholds of improvement during acute treatment. Results: Variation in six depressive symptoms (difficulty having fun, social withdrawal, excessive fatigue, irritability, low self-esteem, and depressed feelings) assessed with the Children’s Depression Rating Scale-Revised at 4–6 weeks predicted treatment outcomes with fluoxetine at 10–12 weeks with an average accuracy of 73% in the training dataset. The same six symptoms predicted 10–12 week outcomes at 4–6 weeks in (a) duloxetine testing datasets with an average accuracy of 76% and (b) placebo-treated patients with accuracies of 67%. In placebo-treated patients, the accuracies of predicting response and remission were similar to antidepressants. Accuracies for predicting nonresponse to placebo treatment were significantly lower than antidepressants. Conclusions: PGMs provided clinically meaningful predictions in samples of depressed children and adolescents treated with fluoxetine or duloxetine. Future work should augment PGMs with biological data for refined predictions to guide the selection of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment in children and adolescents with depression.

"Journal Article","What the future holds: Machine learning to predict success in psychotherapy.","Machine learning (ML) may help to predict successful psychotherapy outcomes and to identify relevant predictors of success. So far, ML applications are scant in psychotherapy research and they are typically based on small samples or focused on specific diagnoses. In this study, we predict successful therapy outcomes with ML in a heterogeneous sample in routine outpatient care. We trained established ML models (decision trees and ensembles of them) with routinely collected clinical baseline information from n = 685 outpatients to predict a successful outcome of cognitive behavioral therapy. Treatment success was defined as clinically significant change (CSC) on the Brief-Symptom-Checklist (reached by 326 patients; 48%). The best performing model (Gradient Boosting Machines) achieved a balanced accuracy of 69% (p < .001) on unseen validation data. Out of 383 variables, we identified the 16 most important predictors, which were still able to predict CSC with 67% balanced accuracy. Our study demonstrates that ML models built on data, which is typically available at the outset of therapy, can predict whether an individual will substantially benefit from the intervention. Some of the predictors were theoretically expected (e.g., level of functioning), but others need further validation (e.g., somatization). From a theoretical and practical perspective, ML is clearly an attractive addition to more established psychotherapy research methodology.

"Journal Article","Information extraction from free text for aiding transdiagnostic psychiatry: Constructing NLP pipelines tailored to clinicians’ needs.","Background: Developing predictive models for precision psychiatry is challenging because of unavailability of the necessary data: extracting useful information from existing electronic health record (EHR) data is not straightforward, and available clinical trial datasets are often not representative for heterogeneous patient groups. The aim of this study was constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline that extracts variables for building predictive models from EHRs. We specifically tailor the pipeline for extracting information on outcomes of psychiatry treatment trajectories, applicable throughout the entire spectrum of mental health disorders (“transdiagnostic”). Methods: A qualitative study into beliefs of clinical staff on measuring treatment outcomes was conducted to construct a candidate list of variables to extract from the EHR. To investigate if the proposed variables are suitable for measuring treatment effects, resulting themes were compared to transdiagnostic outcome measures currently used in psychiatry research and compared to the HDRS (as a gold standard) through systematic review, resulting in an ideal set of variables. To extract these from EHR data, a semi-rule based NLP pipeline was constructed and tailored to the candidate variables using Prodigy. Classification accuracy and F1-scores were calculated and pipeline output was compared to HDRS scores using clinical notes from patients admitted in 2019 and 2020. Results: Analysis of 34 questionnaires answered by clinical staff resulted in four themes defining treatment outcomes: symptom reduction, general well-being, social functioning and personalization. Systematic review revealed 242 different transdiagnostic outcome measures, with the 36-item Short-Form Survey for quality of life (SF36) being used most consistently, showing substantial overlap with the themes from the qualitative study. Comparing SF36 to HDRS scores in 26 studies revealed moderate to good correlations (0.62—0.79) and good positive predictive values (0.75—0.88). The NLP pipeline developed with notes from 22,170 patients reached an accuracy of 95 to 99 percent (F1 scores: 0.38 – 0.86) on detecting these themes, evaluated on data from 361 patients. Conclusions: The NLP pipeline developed in this study extracts outcome measures from the EHR that cater specifically to the needs of clinical staff and align with outcome measures used to detect treatment effects in clinical trials.

"Journal Article","Computational approaches to treatment response prediction in major depression using brain activity and behavioral data: A systematic review.","Major depressive disorder is a heterogeneous diagnostic category with multiple available treatments. With the goal of optimizing treatment selection, researchers are developing computational models that attempt to predict treatment response based on various pretreatment measures. In this paper, we review studies that use brain activity data to predict treatment response. Our aim is to highlight and clarify important methodological differences between various studies that relate to the incorporation of domain knowledge, specifically within two approaches delineated as data-driven and theory-driven. We argue that theory-driven generative modeling, which explicitly models information processing in the brain and thus can capture disease mechanisms, is a promising emerging approach that is only beginning to be utilized in treatment response prediction. The predictors extracted via such models could improve interpretability, which is critical for clinical decision-making. We also identify several methodological limitations across the reviewed studies and provide suggestions for addressing them. Namely, we consider problems with dichotomizing treatment outcomes, the importance of investigating more than one treatment in a given study for differential treatment response predictions, the need for a patient-centered approach for defining treatment outcomes, and finally, the use of internal and external validation methods for improving model generalizability.

"Journal Article","Machine learning enhances prediction of illness course: A longitudinal study in eating disorders.","Background: Psychiatric disorders, including eating disorders (EDs), have clinical outcomes that range widely in severity and chronicity. The ability to predict such outcomes is extremely limited. Machine-learning (ML) approaches that model complexity may optimize the prediction of multifaceted psychiatric behaviors. However, the investigations of many psychiatric concerns have not capitalized on ML to improve prognosis. This study conducted the first comparison of an ML approach (elastic net regularized logistic regression) to traditional regression to longitudinally predict ED outcomes. Methods: Females with heterogeneous ED diagnoses completed demographic and psychiatric assessments at baseline (n = 415) and Year 1 (n = 320) and 2 (n = 277) follow-ups. Elastic net and traditional logistic regression models comprising the same baseline variables were compared in ability to longitudinally predict ED diagnosis, binge eating, compensatory behavior, and underweight BMI at Years 1 and 2. Results: Elastic net models had higher accuracy for all outcomes at Years 1 and 2 [average Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) = 0.78] compared to logistic regression (average AUC = 0.67). Model performance did not deteriorate when the most important predictor was removed or an alternative ML algorithm (random forests) was applied. Baseline ED (e.g. diagnosis), psychiatric (e.g. hospitalization), and demographic (e.g. ethnicity) characteristics emerged as important predictors in exploratory predictor importance analyses. Conclusions: ML algorithms can enhance the prediction of ED symptoms for 2 years and may identify important risk markers. The superior accuracy of ML for predicting complex outcomes suggests that these approaches may ultimately aid in advancing precision medicine for serious psychiatric disorders.

"Journal Article","A random forest model for predicting social functional improvement in Chinese patients with schizophrenia after 3 months of atypical antipsychotic monopharmacy: A cohort study.","Purpose: Impaired social functions contribute to the burden of schizophrenia patients and their families, but predictive tools of social functioning prognosis and specific factors are undefined in Chinese clinical practice. This article explores a machine learning tool to identify whether patients will achieve significant social functional improvement after 3 months of atypical antipsychotic monopharmacy and finds the defined risk factors using a multicenter clinical study. Patients and Methods: A multicenter study on atypical antipsychotic (AAP) treatment in Chinese patients with schizophrenia (SALT-C) was conducted from July 2011 to August 2018. Data from 550 patients with AAP monopharmacy from their baseline to their 3-month follow-up were used to establish machine learning tools after screening. The positive outcome was an increase in the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale score by ≥ 10 points. The predictors were a range of investigator-rated assessments on symptoms, functioning, the safety of AAPs and illness history. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was used for the feature screening and ranking of the predicted variables. The random forest algorithm and five-fold cross-validation for optimizing the model were selected to ensure the generalizability and precision. Results: There were 137 patients (mean [SD] age, 41.1 [16.8] years; 77 [58.8%] female) who had a good social functional prognosis. A lower PSP score, taking a mood stabilizer, a high total Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and PANSS general subscale score, unemployment, a hepatic injury with medication, comorbid cardiovascular disease and being male predicted poor PSP outcomes. The generalizability of the PSP predictive tool was estimated with the precision–recall curve (accuracy of 79.5%, negative predictive value of 92.6% and positive predictive value of 57.1%) and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) (specificity of 81.8% and sensitivity of 78.7%). Conclusion: The machine learning tool established using our current real-world data could assist in predicting PSP outcome by several clinical factors.

"Journal Article","Predicting outcome of daycare cognitive behavioural therapy in a naturalistic sample of patients with PTSD: A machine learning approach.","Background: Identifying predictors for treatment outcome in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is important in order to provide an effective treatment, but robust and replicated treatment outcome predictors are not available up to now. Objectives: We investigated predictors of treatment outcome in a naturalistic sample of patients with PTSD admitted to an 8-week daycare cognitive behavioural therapy programme following a wide range of traumatic events. Method: We used machine learning (linear and non-linear regressors and cross-validation) to predict outcome at discharge for 116 patients and sustained treatment effects 6 months after discharge for 52 patients who had a follow-up assessment. Predictions were based on a wide selection of demographic and clinical assessments including age, gender, comorbid psychiatric disorders, trauma history, posttraumatic symptoms, posttraumatic cognitions, depressive symptoms, general psychopathology and psychosocial functioning. Results: We found that demographic and clinical variables significantly, but only modestly predicted PTSD treatment outcome at discharge (r = 0.21, p = .021 for the best model) and follow-up (r = 0.31, p = .026). Among the included variables, more severe posttraumatic cognitions were negatively associated with treatment outcome. Early response in PTSD symptomatology (percentage change of symptom scores after 4 weeks of treatment) allowed more accurate predictions of outcome at discharge (r = 0.56, p r = 0.43, p = .001). Conclusion: Our results underscore the importance of early treatment response for short- and long-term treatment success. Nevertheless, it remains an unresolved challenge to identify variables that can robustly predict outcome before the initiation of treatment.

"Journal Article","Combining machine learning algorithms for prediction of antidepressant treatment response.","Objectives: Predictors for unfavorable treatment outcome in major depressive disorder (MDD) applicable for treatment selection are still lacking. The database of a longitudinal multicenter study on 1079 acutely depressed patients, performed by the German research network on depression (GRND), allows supervised and unsupervised learning to further elucidate the interplay of clinical and psycho‐sociodemographic variables and their predictive impact on treatment outcome phenotypes. Experimental Procedures: Treatment response was defined by a change of HAM‐D 17‐item baseline score ≥ 50% and remission by the established threshold of ≤ 7, respectively, after up to eight weeks of inpatient treatment. After hierarchical symptom clustering and stratification by treatment subtypes (serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotic, and lithium augmentation), prediction models for different outcome phenotypes were computed with random forest in a cross‐center validation design. In total, 88 predictors were implemented. Results: Clustering revealed four distinct HAM‐D subscores related to emotional, anxious, sleep, and appetite symptoms, respectively. After feature selection, classification models reached moderate to high accuracies up to 0.85. Highest accuracies were observed for the SSRI and TCA subgroups and for sleep and appetite symptoms, while anxious symptoms showed poor predictability. Conclusion: Our results support a decisive role for machine learning in the management of antidepressant treatment. Treatment‐ and symptom‐specific algorithms may increase accuracies by reducing heterogeneity. Especially, predictors related to duration of illness, baseline depression severity, anxiety and somatic symptoms, and personality traits moderate treatment success. However, prospectives application of machine learning models will be necessary to prove their value for the clinic.

"Journal Article","Pretreatment brain connectome fingerprint predicts treatment response in major depressive disorder.","Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment is characterized by low remission rate and often involves weeks to months of treatment. Identification of pretreatment biomarkers of response may play a critical role in novel drug development, in enhanced prognostic predictions, and perhaps in providing more personalized medicine. Using a network restricted strength predictive modeling (NRS-PM) approach, the goal of the current study was to identify pretreatment functional connectome fingerprints (CFPs) that (1) predict symptom improvement regardless of treatment modality and (2) predict treatment specific improvement. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral data from unmedicated patients with MDD (n = 200) were investigated. Participants were randomized to daily treatment of sertraline or placebo for 8 weeks. NRS-PM with 1000 iterations of 10 cross-validation were implemented to identify brain connectivity signatures that predict percent improvement in depression severity at week-8. Results: The study identified a pretreatment CFP that significantly predicts symptom improvement independent of treatment modality but failed to identify a treatment specific CFP. Regardless of treatment modality, improved antidepressant response was predicted by high pretreatment connectivity between modules in the default mode network and the rest of the brain, but low external connectivity in the executive network. Moreover, high pretreatment internal nodal connectivity in the bilateral caudate predicted better response. Conclusions: The identified CFP may contribute to drug development and ultimately to enhanced prognostic predictions. However, the results do not assist with providing personalized medicine, as pretreatment functional connectivity failed to predict treatment specific response.

"Journal Article","Influencing factors and machine learning-based prediction of side effects in psychotherapy.","Background: Side effects in psychotherapy are a common phenomenon, but due to insufficient understanding of the relevant predictors of side effects in psychotherapy, many psychotherapists or clinicians fail to identify and manage these side effects. The purpose of this study was to predict whether clients or patients would experience side effects in psychotherapy by machine learning and to analyze the related influencing factors. Methods: A self-compiled “Psychotherapy Side Effects Questionnaire (PSEQ)” was delivered online by a WeChat official account. Three hundred and seventy participants were included in the cross-sectional analysis. Psychotherapy outcomes were classified as participants with side effects and without side effects. A number of features were selected to distinguish participants with different psychotherapy outcomes. Six machine learning-based algorithms were then chosen and trained by our dataset to build outcome prediction classifiers. Results: Our study showed that: (1) the most common side effects were negative emotions in psychotherapy, such as anxiety, tension, sadness, and anger, etc. (24.6%, 91/370); (2) the mental state of the psychotherapist, as perceived by the participant during psychotherapy, was the most relevant feature to predict whether clients would experience side effects in psychotherapy; (3) a Random Forest-based machine learning classifier offered the best prediction performance of the psychotherapy outcomes, with an F1-score of 0.797 and an AUC value of 0.804. These numbers indicate a high prediction performance, which allowed our approach to be used in practice. Conclusions: Our Random Forest-based machine learning classifier could accurately predict the possible outcome of a client in psychotherapy. Our study sheds light on the influencing factors of the side effects of psychotherapy and could help psychotherapists better predict the outcomes of psychotherapy.

"Journal Article","Connectome-based models can predict early symptom improvement in major depressive disorder.","Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating mental illness with more than 50% of patients not achieving an adequate response using first-line treatments. Reliable models that predict antidepressant treatment outcome are needed to guide clinical decision making. We aimed to build predictive models of treatment improvement for MDD patients using machine learning approaches based on fMRI resting-state functional connectivity patterns. Methods: Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 192 untreated MDD patients at recruitment, and their severity of depression was assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) at baseline. Patients were given medication after the initial MR scan and their symptoms were monitored through HAMD for a period of six months. Connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) algorithms were implemented to predict the improvement in HAMD score at one month from resting-state connectivity at baseline. Additionally, by selectively combining the features from all leave-one-out iterations in the model building stage, we created a consensus model that could be generalized to predict improvement in HAMD score in samples of non-overlapping subjects at different time points. Results: Using baseline functional connectivity, CPM successfully predicted symptom improvement of depression at one month. In addition, a consensus ‘MDD improvement model’ could predict symptom improvement for novel individuals at the two-week, one-month, two-month and three-month time points after antidepressant treatment. Conclusions: Individual pre-treatment functional brain networks contain meaningful information that can be gleaned to build predictors of treatment outcome. The identified MDD improvement networks could be an appropriate biomarker for predicting individual therapeutic response of antidepressant treatment. Replication and validation using other large datasets will be a key next step before these models can be used in clinical practice.

"Journal Article","Machine-learning approaches to substance-abuse research: Emerging trends and their implications.","Purpose of review: To provide an accessible overview of some of the most recent trends in the application of machine learning to the field of substance use disorders and their implications for future research and practice. Recent findings: Machine-learning (ML) techniques have recently been applied to substance use disorder (SUD) data for multiple predictive applications including detecting current abuse, assessing future risk and predicting treatment success. These models cover a wide range of machine-learning techniques and data types including physiological measures, longitudinal surveys, treatment outcomes, national surveys, medical records and social media. Summary: The application of machine-learning models to substance use disorder data shows significant promise, with some use cases and data types showing high predictive accuracy, particularly for models of physiological and behavioral measures for predicting current substance use, portending potential clinical diagnostic applications; however, these results are uneven, with some models performing poorly or at chance, a limitation likely reflecting insufficient data and/or weak validation methods. The field will likely benefit from larger and more multimodal datasets, greater standardization of data recording and rigorous testing protocols as well as greater use of modern deep neural network models applied to multimodal unstructured datasets.

"Journal Article","Personalized prognostic prediction of treatment outcome for depressed patients in a naturalistic psychiatric hospital setting: A comparison of machine learning approaches.","Objective: Research on predictors of treatment outcome in depression has largely derived from randomized clinical trials involving strict standardization of treatments, stringent patient exclusion criteria, and careful selection and supervision of study clinicians. The extent to which findings from such studies generalize to naturalistic psychiatric settings is unclear. This study sought to predict depression outcomes for patients seeking treatment within an intensive psychiatric hospital setting and while comparing the performance of a range of machine learning approaches. Method: Depressed patients (N = 484; ages 18–72; 89% White) receiving treatment within a psychiatric partial hospital program delivering pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy were split into a training sample and holdout sample. First, within the training sample, 51 pretreatment variables were submitted to 13 machine learning algorithms to predict, via cross-validation, posttreatment Patient Health Questionnaire–9 depression scores. Second, the best performing modeling approach (lowest mean squared error; MSE) from the training sample was selected to predict outcome in the holdout sample. Results: The best performing model in the training sample was elastic net regularization (ENR; MSE = 20.49, R2 = .28), which had comparable performance in the holdout sample (MSE = 11.26; R2 = .38). There were 14 pretreatment variables that predicted outcome. To demonstrate the translation of an ENR model to personalized prediction of treatment outcome, a patient-specific prognosis calculator is presented. Conclusions: Informed by pretreatment patient characteristics, such predictive models could be used to communicate prognosis to clinicians and to guide treatment planning. Identified predictors of poor prognosis may suggest important targets for intervention.

"Journal Article","A machine learning ensemble to predict treatment outcomes following an Internet intervention for depression.","Background: Some Internet interventions are regarded as effective treatments for adult depression, but less is known about who responds to this form of treatment. Method: An elastic net and random forest were trained to predict depression symptoms and related disability after an 8-week course of an Internet intervention, Deprexis, involving adults (N = 283) from across the USA. Candidate predictors included psychopathology, demographics, treatment expectancies, treatment usage, and environmental context obtained from population databases. Model performance was evaluated using predictive R²(R²pred), the expected variance explained in a new sample, estimated by 10 repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation. Results: An ensemble model was created by averaging the predictions of the elastic net and random forest. Model performance was compared with a benchmark linear autoregressive model that predicted each outcome using only its baseline. The ensemble predicted more variance in post-treatment depression (8.0% gain, 95% CI 0.8–15; total R²pred = 0.25), disability (5.0% gain, 95% CI −0.3 to 10; total R²pred = 0.25), and well-being (11.6% gain, 95% CI 4.9–19; total R²pred = 0.29) than the benchmark model. Important predictors included comorbid psychopathology, particularly total psychopathology and dysthymia, low symptom-related disability, treatment credibility, lower access to therapists, and time spent using certain Deprexis modules. Conclusion:A number of variables predict symptom improvement following an Internet intervention, but each of these variables makes relatively small contributions. Machine learning ensembles may be a promising statistical approach for identifying the cumulative contribution of many weak predictors to psychosocial depression treatment response.

"Journal Article","Prediction of rTMS treatment response in major depressive disorder using machine learning techniques and nonlinear features of EEG signal.","Background: Prediction of therapeutic outcome of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment is an important purpose that eliminates financial and psychological consequences of applying inefficient therapy. To achieve this goal we proposed a method based on machine learning to classify responders (R) and non-responders (NR) to rTMS treatment for major depression disorder (MDD) patients. Methods: 19 electrodes resting state EEG was recorded from 46 MDD patients before treatment. Then patients underwent 7 weeks of rTMS, and 23 of them responded to treatment. Features extracted from EEG include Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), Katz fractal dimension (KFD), correlation dimension (CD), the power spectral density, features based on bispectrum, frontal and prefrontal cordance and combination of them. The most relevant features were selected by the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithm. For classifying two groups of R and NR, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) were applied. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by leave-1-out cross-validation. For further study, the capability of features in differentiating R and NR was investigated by a statistical test. Results: Effective EEG features for prediction of rTMS treatment response were found. EEG beta power, the sum of bispectrum diagonal elements in delta and beta bands and CD were the most discriminative features. Power of beta classified R and NR with the high performance of 91.3% accuracy, 91.3% specificity, and 91.3% sensitivity. Limitations: Lack of large sample size restricted our method for using in clinical applications. Conclusion: This considerable high accuracy indicates that our proposed method with power and some of the nonlinear and bispectral features can lead to promising results in predicting treatment outcome of rTMS for MDD patients only by one session pretreatment EEG recording.

"Journal Article","A systematic meta-review of predictors of antidepressant treatment outcome in major depressive disorder.","Introduction: The heterogeneity of symptoms and complex etiology of depression pose a significant challenge to the personalization of treatment. Meanwhile, the current application of generic treatment approaches to patients with vastly differing biological and clinical profiles is far from optimal. Here, we conduct a meta-review to identify predictors of response to antidepressant therapy in order to select robust input features for machine learning models of treatment response. These machine learning models will allow us to learn associations between patient features and treatment response which have predictive value at the individual patient level; this learning can be optimized by selecting high-quality input features for the model. While current research is difficult to directly apply to the clinic, machine learning models built using knowledge gleaned from current research may become useful clinical tools. Methods: The EMBASE and MEDLINE/PubMed online databases were searched from January 1996 to August 2017, using a combination of MeSH terms and keywords to identify relevant literature reviews. We identified a total of 1909 articles, wherein 199 articles met our inclusion criteria. Results: An array of genetic, immune, endocrine, neuroimaging, sociodemographic, and symptom-based predictors of treatment response were extracted, varying widely in clinical utility. Limitations: Due to heterogeneous sample sizes, effect sizes, publication biases, and methodological disparities across reviews, we could not accurately assess the strength and directionality of every predictor. Conclusion: Notwithstanding our cautious interpretation of the results, we have identified a multitude of predictors that can be used to formulate a priori hypotheses regarding the input features for a computational model. We highlight the importance of large-scale research initiatives and clinically accessible biomarkers, as well as the need for replication studies of current findings. In addition, we provide recommendations for future improvement and standardization of research efforts in this field.
